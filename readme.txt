Options to manage the WordPress core XML Sitemaps, optimize and fix some bugs.

== Description ==

The light-weight XML Sitemaps Manager allows you to de/activate WordPress core XML sitemaps, change the maximum number of URLs per sitemap and add Last Modified dates.

= Features =

* Options to disable the complete sitemap index or exclude certain post type sitemaps, taxonomy sitemaps or the user sitemap.
* Change the maximum number of URLs in the sitemaps.
* Add **Last Modified** dates to posts, terms, users and the first sitemap of each type in the index.
* Conditional **is_sitemap()**, [ticket](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/51543), and **is_sitemap_stylesheet()** for good measure.
* Polylang compatible.
* Multisite compatible: Can be network activated. On uninstallation, all sub-site options will be cleared from the database as long as not is_large_network().
* Additional fixes and improvents to the core XML Sitemap.

Fixes some core XML Sitemap bugs:
- Blog page lastmod in WP 6.5 (use last post date instead of last modified date)
- 404 Response code on certain sitemaps, [ticket](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/51912).
- Don't set is_home() true, [ticket](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/51542).
- Don't execute main query, [ticket](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/51117).
- Ignore stickyness in WP 6.0 and below, [ticket](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55633) (fixed in WP 6.1).

Improves core XML Sitemap performance by reducing the number of database queries for:
- the sitemap index by 5;
- each post type sitemap by 4;
- each taxonomy sitemap by the number of terms in that sitemap, [ticket](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55239) (fixed in WP 6.0);
- each user sitemap by the number of users in that sitemap.
